# manga_scraper
This scraper converts manga on mangahub to a merged pdf file. However, this scraper is only to be used for research purposes and not to read any manga itself.

Use `download_manga -title- -url-`
where title is the title for the download folder where the file is placed (will be placed in the folder of the download_manga.py file) and url is the mangahub url.

Example `download_manga ajin https://mangahub.io/manga/ajin_101`
